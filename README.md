# 8cave
The first game I created using JS back when I was in school (~2010).
It is a little buggy and it is probably better to not look at the code too closely...
It is mostly the original code with minor changes to make it run without a PHP backend.

**Warning**: Loud volumes! 
Do not play if you have **photosensitive epilepsy**!
